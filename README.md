# NeuroDetect
NeuroDetect AI is a dual-function deep learning system designed to provide critical insights from brain tumor MRI scans. It uses a novel ensemble model for accurate tumor type classification, but its key innovation is a unique hybrid model for non-invasive glioma grading. By analyzing standard MRI slices, NeuroDetect predicts whether a glioma is Low-Grade or High-Grade, a determination that typically requires a risky, invasive surgical biopsy. The system, prototyped as a mobile app, aims to give clinicians this vital information early and non-invasively, supporting safer and more effective treatment planning.
